# EPITACK
An epilespy convulsion attack alarm-sensor

<p>Epitack is a machine learning project that predicts whether someone is convulsing or not based on certain features. This repository contains the code for training a Random Forest classifier model and creating a dashboard to demonstrate its functionality. The ultimate goal is to integrate this model into a Wear OS app for real-time monitoring.</p>

## Features
<ul>
<li>Trained Random Forest classifier model for convulsion prediction.</li>
<li>Dashboard to manually input features and visualize predictions.</li>
</ul>
